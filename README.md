# Avocado Classifier

## Purpose.

The purpose of this project is twofold: 
- to theoretically examine the extent to which a logistic regression model with a neural network can classify images. 
- to gain practical experience with the following: 
  - creating, reshaping, broadcasting and performing mathematical operations with vectors using *NumPy*;
  - preprocessing and converting image data into vectors using *PIL*; and
  - combining the different parts of a shallow neural network algorithm into a class.
