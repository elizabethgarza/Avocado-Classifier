# Avocado Classifier

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is: 
1. to theoretically examine the extent to which a logistic regression model with a neural network can classify images. 
2. to gain practical experience with the following: 
   - preprocessing and converting image data into vector arrays using `PIL`; 
   - creating, reshaping, broadcasting and performing mathematical operations with vector arrays using `NumPy`; and
   - combining the different parts of a shallow neural network algorithm into a class.
