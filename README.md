# Avocado Classifier

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is: 
1. to theoretically examine the extent to which a logistic regression model with a neural network can classify images. 
2. to gain practical experience with the following: 
   - preprocessing and converting image data into vector arrays using `PIL`; 
   - creating, reshaping, broadcasting and performing mathematical operations with vector arrays using `NumPy`; and
   - combining the different parts of a shallow neural network algorithm into a class, including 

## Data

The data comes from a directory called [fruit-360 | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) and consists of the following features: 
- 297 images were used in total, with 167 images of avocados, and 130 images of other miscellaneous fruits and vegetables. 
- each square image is of shape (100, 100, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels on the RGC scale.
